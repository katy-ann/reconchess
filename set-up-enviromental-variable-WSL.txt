this is not a permanent option and will need to be done every time you restart your terminal: 
export PATH=/path/to/folder:$PATH
problems with this method: at first the export PATH pointed to the right file, but when tested using python os.env it was unable to find the file. 
double check which directory the file(s) have been stored in 
########################################################################
permanent option: add the variable to your .bashrc file
to access your .bashrc file copy and paste this: vim /etc/bash.bashrc , to access your .bashrc file
then type: export VARNAME=/path/to/whatever/you/need
if this isn't done when you try to run the trout bot, the script will raise either a value error or a key error.
